# SignalAtlas

**SignalAtlas** is an interactive, zoomable web visualization of the entire known radio frequency spectrum. It allows users to explore frequency bands, navigate through standard band regions (like VHF/UHF), search specific frequencies, and view allocations sourced from publicly available spectrum charts.
